# The `in` folder

The `in` folder contains the pertinents 3D objects describing the Arch model. That is to say
- the discontinuities (triangulated surfaces)
- the grids (points, lines, surfaces, volumes)

It contains also other relevant text files if necessary (user files), that are not used by Arch.
