<h3>To do list 1</h3>

- Have a panel to change the remote / pressures / density / young
- Change from hydro to litho ?

- However, a discontinuity can be switch off/on
- All skins for grids are global for all of them
- However, a grid can be switch off/on
- Grids are classified by type (points, regular, triangulated...)

<h3>To do list 2 (later on)</h3>

- Have a possibility to call Arch from the browser (wasm) in order to compute stress at new grids (wells...)
- Have the dynamic streamline in 3D inside a ficticious grid

<h3>To do list 3</h3>

- Make the Arch computations possible within the browser
